## Attendance application

Here's a demo application which uses Laravel4 for the backend, and backbone.js for the frontend.
The administrator will be able to manage:
*  Users - We just store the user's name for now
*  Groups - Groups of users
*  Status - The different attendance statuses (present, absent, excused, late, etc)
*  Attendances - Records of a user's attendance for a specific day
